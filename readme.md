# My Rocket League clone

# doing
- do custom car physics
  - reduce in air friction
  - dont steer or accel in air
  - only one double jump
  - prevent bouncing when hitting the ground on wheels

# todo
- do arcade car
- wheel collider car
  - pain in the arse to get good settings
    - I don't understand the friction model. How to eliminate slip?
  - find good torque/friction etc settings
    - default values: too slippery
    - high stiffness: very jittery

  - cam angle calculation isn't right
